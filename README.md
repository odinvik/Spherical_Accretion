# Spherical_Accretion
I shall continue updating this folder with codes related to the *Spherical Accretion on to a Black Hole*. Initially I shall upload the codes to draw the Mach numver vs distance topology for the *steady state accretion*. The flows considered here are inviscid and everwhere sub-Keplarian. Atleast for the time being, we are not considering any energy dissipation. I am farely new to this filed. Any query, feedback, etc. should be addressed to </span "color: green"> dr.souvikghose@gmail.com </span>.
